# Portfolio Project
- Tried to mock up the example but came into some cool ideas googling like a floating nav bar. 
- my page features a simple header, a body with a photo to the left and text wraped on the right side that with more content should go back to occupying the whole width of the page. The navigation link will bring you to the top for about me, my work to the 4 boxed with image backgrounds that i want to eventually link to different pages, and the contact will lead to bottom of the page.

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager’s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work -->
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
