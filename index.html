        <h2 id="About_me">Background</h2>
        <p>My name is Mikell. My name is pronounced "Michael." I grew up in Olympia, Washington and currently residing in Federal Way, Washington. I graduated from River Ridge High School where i spent most of my late teens and early 20s working as a cook for varias restuarants. I earned my Pharmacy Technician License in 2015. I worked at Safeway for a brief period but was hired at then Group Health at their Pharmacy Contact Center. I would process prescriptions and do the occasional filling at the Fulfillment Center when asked. A year later i would apply for Kaiser Permanente Specialty pharmacy, a sub division of the pharmacy that manages high cost medication for numerous disease states. I am still currently employed with the specialty pharmacy but my role has transition from front-line to Lead Pharmacy Technician.</<p>

        <h2>Personal</h2>
        <p>I was born October 8th, 1989. I have two kids. My son is named Mayson and my daughter is named Belle. I share these two wonderful kids with my girlfriend, May.
        </p>
        <p>Growing up i feel i made decisions on impulse and always chose the easy route. However, as i've gotten older i've learned easy is not always right. I've spent the last two years juggling multiple tasks to improve aspect of my life that would benefit my kids. I'm currently working full time and have been pursuiting my education in Computer Science Engineer. With the edition of the UW Bootcamp, i'm focused on a career i've felt was suited for me growing up and even until now. I look forward to getting my foot in the door after bootcamp and then further learing through the university.
